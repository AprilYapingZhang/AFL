### Dependency

* Please use python3, as we cannot guarantee its compatibility with python2.
* Our code is based on Anaconda.
* The version of Tensorflow we use is 1.10.1.
* Other depencencies:

    ```
    pip install keras
    ```

### Usage
0. Clone the repo.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/AprilYapingZhang/AFL.git
    cd AFL
    ```

#### Using ready-made data

1. Download the prepared data in hdf5 from  [Baidu Yun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1W16muirZk1-2lYCbIJdiIg) with passwd pf7f  , to the repo root, and uncompress it.

   NOTE: For the raw  [CASIA-HWDB]( http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/databases/handwriting/Application_form.html), built by the CASIA, are released for academic research free of cost under an agreement. 
    
   
2. Make sure the structure looks like the following:

    ```shell
    data/:
    CASIA_HWDB_1.0_1.1_data
    data/CASIA_HWDB_1.0_1.1_data:
    norm_hand_pair_3755.hdf5  trn-HWDB1.0-1.1-3756-uint8.hdf5  tst-HWDB1.0-1.1-3756-uint8.hdf5

    ```

3. Run model
    * Download the pretrain weights from  [Baidu Yun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1XemKKJqxu9ZDhgcZQlY9dw) with passwd `ie3j` , to the repo root.
        
    * Run Baseline:

        ```shell
        python baseline.py --data_dir ./data
        ```

    * Run AFL model:

        ```shell 
        python main.py --data_dir ./data --pretrain_weights ./pre_weights.hdf5
        ```
